\paragraph{Rui Pinto}
was born in October of 1988 and raised in \textbf{"Mafamude"}, a small town in the North of Portugal.
Since very early in his life, Pinto was very invested in football, he was especially fanatic for FC Porto, a football club established very close to his home town.

\textit{"Faculdade de Letras da Universidade do Porto"} is where he cultivated his education, where he studied History, and where he enrolled in the Erasmus program to study abroad in Budapest, Hungary.

While being abroad, in 2013, Pinto was involved in several cyber attacks to the \textit{Caledonian Bank} which had the objective of transferring 264 thousand dollars to the \textit{Deutsche Bank} but was ultimately discovered by the authorities and detained before the transaction was actually completed.

With help from his lawyer, Aníbal Pinto, he was saved from a bigger sentence that lead, in 2014 to the decision from \textit{"Departamento de Investigação e Ação Penal do Porto"} to archive the case and settle for an extralegal accord between Rui Pinto and the Bank, out of which resulted a 100 thousand dollar fine.

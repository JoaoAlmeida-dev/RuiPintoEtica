\subsection{Primary Ethical questions}
During the whole process, Rui had no professional obligation to abide by, except the moral rules and laws that every citizen is placed under.

By accessing the internal servers/services of Sporting Football Club and obtaining confidential documents, even if done with a good intention in mind, is still breaking the privacy of the referenced Club and all the people that these documents mentioned.
Beyond being a privacy breach, we have to question ourselves on how did Rui Pinto actually gain access to these documents, he was not an employee of Sporting, he himself did not have personal access to the system, so he had to, at one point or another, breach the security  of their system.
By persuading and promising his silence to the Big Football clubs regarding their confidential documents in exchange of money he committed a very severe crime of extorsion, manipulating the organizations to do what he wanted, holding these documents as a way of making them kneel before his will.
Here we have in question the main goal of Rui Pinto, was it to actually create a better Football scene and environment like the website auto-proclaimed or is it for self benefit?


\begin{itemize}
    \item Is it Ethical to "hack" into someone's email, essentially break their privacy, to know if that someone is involved in some sort of bad deed, some sort of corruption or law breaking?
    \item Is it right to break a law in order to find who is breaking the law?
    \item On the other hand, should privacy laws protect us so much that we have the freedom to hide unlawful acts behind it?
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Ethical knowledge and sensibility, harmed entities}
Rui Pinto, at a first glance of the facts does in fact seem like a person who is invested in doing the right thing, by publishing so much information about corrupt activities, which lead to the investigation of multiple parties, he effectively assisted the police in several other cases.

But things are not so simple with Rui, even before the case of Football Leaks, the cyber attacks to the \textit{Caledonian Bank} which he was involved in served as a precedent for his extortions of Doyen Sports, FC Sporting  Football Leaks.

It is according to the european whistleblowers directive that a "whistleblower" is a person that \textit{"By reporting breaches of Union law that are harmful to the public interest, such persons act as ‘whistleblowers’"}
\footnote{DIRECTIVE (EU) 2019/1937 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 23 October 2019 on the protection of persons who report breaches of Union law \url{https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32019L1937}}
So when Rui Pinto made a new post on Football Leaks exposing their illicit actions, instead of calling the correspondent authorities he did not act according to this directive.

When he was put in prison and extradited from Hungary back to Portugal, Pinto's life was put on hold.

\subsection{Systematic analysis}
\subsubsection{Professional Standarts}
\subsubsection{Involved Actors}
The involved actors are primarily Rui Pinto and his anonymous team on the Football Leaks website, his lawyer, and on the other side of the stick there is all the impacted organizations, such as FC Sporting, its team coach, Jorge Jesus, Cristiano Ronaldo, which was involved in a leaked case on the website.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item From all the people involved in this case, Rui Pinto is the most important one, he is the one who claimed ownership of the popular website, he is the one who is being hold on trial directly.
    \item All of the anonymous people helping in the management of the Leaks are as important as Pinto himself, the only diference is that as we cannot identify these people, the case and all of the social impact is directed at Rui Pinto.
    \item His lawyer Anibal Pinto is also an important "piece of the puzzle", whitout him, pinto would not have been able to contest on his first attack to \textit{Caledonian Bank}.
    \item Doyen Sports, who was extorted by Pinto and his lawyer, and had its agreements with FC Twente published online which led to the clubs ban from European Football for three years.
    \item The Portuguese Government which
